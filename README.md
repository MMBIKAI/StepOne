FizzBuzz in Go (first step for 15 iterations)
This is a simple FizzBuzz implementation in Go.

Description
FizzBuzz is a common programming interview question. The task is to print the numbers from 1 to n, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of FizzBuzz in Go, along with unit tests to ensure correctness.

Files
fizzbuzz.go: Contains the implementation of the FizzBuzz function.
fizzbuzz_test.go: Contains the unit tests for the FizzBuzz function.
Usage
To run the FizzBuzz program, you can execute the following command:

go
Copy code
go run fizzbuzz.go
To run the unit tests, you can execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
go test -v
