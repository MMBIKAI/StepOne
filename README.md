# FizzBuzz in Go (First Step for 15 Iterations)

This is a simple FizzBuzz implementation in Go.

## Description
FizzBuzz is a common programming interview question. The task is to print the numbers from 1 to `n`, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of FizzBuzz in Go, along with unit tests to ensure correctness.

## Files
- `fizzbuzz.go`: Contains the implementation of the FizzBuzz function.
- `fizzbuzz_test.go`: Contains the unit tests for the FizzBuzz function.

## Usage
To run the FizzBuzz program, you can execute the following command:
```bash
go run fizzbuzz.go
